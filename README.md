ðŸŽ® Creating an Unbeatable Tic Tac Toe AI using Python and the Minimax Algorithm ðŸŽ®
-> What's the project about?
I delved into the world of game development by implementing a Tic Tac Toe AI that never loses. The Minimax algorithm allowed me to create a robust strategy for the AI player to make optimal moves, ensuring victory or, at worst, a draw.
-> What I Learned:
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in AI algorithms, game development, and problem-solving. Understanding the intricacies of the Minimax algorithm was an enlightening experience, highlighting the balance between computational complexity and strategic decision-making.
